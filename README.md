# iscs-thesis

A revised version (v2) of `iscs-thesis`, the LaTeX document class for theses of:

- the Department of Computer Science, the Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, the University of Tokyo (東京大学大学院情報理工学系研究科コンピュータ科学専攻), and
- the Department of Information Science, the Faculty of Science, the University of Tokyo (東京大学理学部情報科学科).

You can simply use [`iscs-thesis.cls`](./iscs-thesis.cls).

Compared to the [original version (v1.3b)](https://www.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp/edu/course/cs/thesis.shtml) (mirrored in [`original/`](./original/)),
this undergoes the following updates:

- Use Unicode and modify fonts for upLaTeX.
- Use 'Acknowledgments' (common US spelling) instead of 'Acknowledgements'.
- Added a space between `\@etitle` and `\@jtitle`.
- Made minor changes to the samples.
